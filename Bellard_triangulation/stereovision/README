Overview:
---------

This package allows to convert two images of the same object into a
three dimensional description. You must know the basis of stereovision
to use this program. This package uses the correlation method to
extract the 3D information. It works very well on textured objects.

The basic stages of the 3D reconstruction are:

1) Extraction the camera parameters, in order to know at which places
the camera are and what are their optical parameters.

2) The rectification which transforms the two images such that the
correlation can be done only on the corresponding horizontal lines.

3) The correlation which finds the same regions in the two images.

4) The filtering to correct the errors of the correlation.

5) The conversion of the horizontal offsets of the correlation into 3D positions.

6) The visualisation of the result.

The program 'rectify' does the first step. The program 'correl' does
the other steps.


Installation:
-------------

Edit the Makefile. You must have OpenGL (or Mesa) to use the
program. Type 'make'. Everything should be compiled.


Testing:
--------

Run the scripts

 buste/test_buste

and

 herve/test_herve.

The latter is rendered with texture mapping.


Feel free to improve this program - send me your patches !
